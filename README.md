# bread-ui

My nickname is bread and this is my ui-theme for atom. Nothing about the way it looks makes me think about bread.

It is a:

- dark ui with reasonable contrast
- tries to use the San Francisco Monospace font
  - [import-sf-mono](https://atom.io/packages/import-sf-mono) shows you where the source files are
  - muhasturk/SFMono offers downloads of the fonts files
- is otherwise pretty similar to the atom-community/ui-theme-template
